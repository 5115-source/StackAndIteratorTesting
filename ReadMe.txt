This repo is a collection of test programs used to get better at creating iterator classes and using stacks. All programs have the added functionality of asking for user input and a valid input checker. All programs also have a more cleaned up terminal output for ease of use with larger calculations.

The repo is organized into different file directories.

 - The Iterator testing folder has a program named FibonacciNum.py that wil call on the class FibonacciIterator.py to iterate trhough different Fibonacci numbers up to a user defined max value.

 - The StackTesting Folder contains two sub folders.
    - GenericStackClassVersion contains the DisplayPrimeNum.py program which relies on the GenericStack.py class to function. This class was originally written in java and was translated to python by ChatGPT.
    - PythonStackVersion contains the DisplayPrimeNumbers.py program which uses the built in stack functionality of python.
