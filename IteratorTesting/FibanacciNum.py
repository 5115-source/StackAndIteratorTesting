"""Define an iterator class named Fibonacci Iterator for iterating Fibonacci numbers.
 The constructor takes an argument that specifies the limit of the maximum Fibonacci number.
 For example, new FibonacciIterator(23302) creates an iterator that iterates Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 23302.
 Write a test program called FibanacciNum.java that uses this iterator to display all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 100000."""
 
#Create a FibonacciIterator(maxNumber) class

#Have that class create an iterator that iterates Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to maxNumber

#Make some testing code in main method that explains directions to user, takes a users input for the maxNumber, and then prints out the iterating numbers

#Then ask user if they want to iterate through all Fibonacci number less than or equal to 100000

#Ask user if they want to iterate through another number or exit the program
